# loan-risk-prediction-app

This is my **MoneyLion Take-Home Assessment**, a data science project focused on developing a **data product using Streamlit** to predict **loan repayment risk**.

The project addresses the **loan repayment challenge** by categorizing applicants into **High Risk** and **Low/Medium Risk** groups based on historical repayment data. The model leverages machine learning to assess the likelihood of default, providing valuable insights for financial decision-making.
